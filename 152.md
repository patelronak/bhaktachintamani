### Divan Dado - Burhanpur, Madhaya Pradesh

Once upon a time in Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh there lived a brahmin named Divan Dado. He was not a satsangi but due to some goodness in his heart, he had offered food to the saints of Shree Swaminarayan Bhagwan. When his life came to an end, unfortunately, yamdoots came to pick him up. When he saw them, he was very scared and tried to call upon different demi Gods, Goddesses, and saints that he had helped in the past but all in vain. He was very dejected and thought to himself that no one can help him now but to his surprise, he saw two saints next to him.

Saints told the yamdoots to let Dado go, but yamdoots politely told the saints that this jiva (Dado) belonged to them since he had committed many sins. Saints still insisted that they should not take him. At that time yamdoots with folded hands asked the saints to please meet with Dharmaraj who will decide on Dado’s faith. Yamdoots took Dado’s soul and started to move towards yampoori. Divan’s wife was a pativrata and she was very sad and she too released her body and went along with them to yampoori.

When Divan, his wife, saints, and yamdoots reached yampoori, Dharmaraj stood up and bowed down to the saints and welcomed them. Dharmaraj opened the book that contained Divan’s life and it contained all the sins along with one good deed where he had fed Swaminarayan Bhagwan's saints. Seeing this Dharmaraj asked Saints to take him to Bhagwan Swaminarayan.

Saints took Divan and his wife to Bhagwan and at that time Bhagwan said they have given food to my saints, so they will go to devlok (land of the Demigods) and from there they will go to Vaikuntha Dham. Great souls that can do Samadhi saw all of this and said to everyone that Divan and his wife will be born in satsang after 9 years and after doing satsang they will reach Akshardham. Everyone was extremely surprised by this and realized this was a great miracle of Shree Swaminarayan Bhagwan.
